iShare for OX X
===============
by Ian Llewellyn

What is it?
-----------
iShare is a small shell script that can be run to enable and start
IP forwarding and NAT services on an OS X based Mac thus making it
a handy little gateway for your LAN.

Install
-------
To install, just copy the iShare script to your Mac. If the script
is not somewhere in your $PATH environment variable, you will have
to invoke it using a path specifier.

How to run
----------
You You will need to make a little edit to the script to specify your
WAN (port_inet) and LAN (port_LAN) interfaces. Then:
$ iShare start
is the simplest way to start the services.

To stop the services, run:
$ iShare stop

To get a bit of status, run:
$ iShare status

Disclaimer
----------
Admitedly the script was hacked together while I was learning and I
brought it as far as I needed it to go. There are no checks of any
kind carried out by the script to ensure consistency of firewall
rules, etc. Sharing has failed for me on many occasions long after
it was started using this script (I recall natd no longer being a
running process, but never tried to track it down).
